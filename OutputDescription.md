All errors (LOG\_ERROR) and warnings (LOG\_WARNING) are logged to syslog if in daemon mode, or output to STDERR in foreground mode.

Informational messages (LOG\_INFO) are logged to syslog (daemon mode) or output on STDOUT (foreground mode) if the currently set verbosity level is equal or higher than the messageÂ´s level. Default verbosity is 0, so no information messages are output.

See here for a list of messages output by level:

### Level 0 ###
None - So with default setting of verbosity 0, no output is generated.

### Level 1 ###
"Started daemon [name](command.md) with PID=[pid](pid.md) on reader [number](reader.md), see /var/log/syslog",
"Daemon Started on reader number [number](reader.md)
"Hangup signal received - will hangup and reconnect"
"SIGTERM received, exiting gracefully"
"Event: Tag [IN|OUT] - UID: [UID](tag.md)"
"SAM Serial: [number of SAM in reader](serial.md)
"SAM ID: [number of SAM in reader](ID.md)

### Level 2 ###
Current Tag state (number of tags present and what are their UIDs)
"Number of tags: [of tags detected ](number.md)"
"Tag ID:   [UID](tag.md)"

"Attempting to execute tag event script [UID as a string](tag.md)"
"Successfully connected to pcscd server"
"Found [of readers found](number.md) Readers, "
"Connected to reader: [number](reader.md)"
"Disconnecting from reader [number](reader.md)"
"Disconnecting from pcscd server"
"Tag Type: MIFARE\_ULTRA"

### Level 3 ###
Lower level commands sent to reader to read status, ATR, tags etc.
"APDU: [data sent as apdu in hex"
"Received: [response](response.md)
"Requesting Response Data ([of response bytes](number.md)"
"Received: [in hex received back](data.md)"

List of readers found on the system in pcscd, and some of their data:
"Reader [number](number.md): [name string as reported by pcscd](reader.md)"
"Firmware: [version string](firmare.md)"
"ATR: [returned by reader](ATR.md)"

Any error reported in a call to the PCSC library, converted to a string by the same library.
