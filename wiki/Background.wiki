At the non-profit Autelic association (http://www.autelic.org) we are trying to develop technology solutions easier to use for all. We execute projects to this end to demonstrate that with a different set of goals and methodologies that major improvements can be made for the benefit of many users who currently won't or can't use existing computers, OS and the Internet.

The proposed projects will change over time, so probably best to check out Autelic web for the latest ideas (http://www.autelic.org).
