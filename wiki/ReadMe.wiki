=== Build Pre-requisites ===
See the SoftwareDependencies page for details on what you need to build and run tagEventor/gtagEventor.

=== How to 'make' - from the command line ===
Type "make" at the command prompt in the source directory.
You can use "make clean" then "make" to ensure you have a clean build.

You should get appropriate output from the make file and be left with tagEventor and gtagEventor (Gtk/GNOME GUI version) executables in the ./bin/Debug and ./bin/Release subdirectories.

== How to build - from an IDE ===
There are projects included for the libReader library, tagEventor command-line program and gtagEventor Gtk/Gnome GUI version for the Code::Blocks Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Open them in Code::Blocks, select the target (Debug or Release) and hit "build" or "fresh build"...

=== How to run ===
See the [Invocation Invocation page] for details on running tagEventor or gtagEventor.

=== How to install ===
See the HowToInstall page for different ways of installing and running automatically the different binaries built.
