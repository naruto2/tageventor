=== Build Pre-requisites ===
You'll need the "pcsc-lite" package on your machine which runes the "pcscd" daemon, if not already there. It maybe called "pcscd".

To develop against PCSCD, including building tagEventor you will need the packages:
  * libpcsclite1 - the library
  * libpcsclite-dev - the header files

== How to make ==
Type "make" at the command prompt in the source directory.
You can use "make clean" then "make" to ensure you have a clean build.

You should get appropriate output from the make file and be left with a tagEventor executable object in the ./bin/Debug and ./bin/Release subdirectories.

How to run
----------
Replace "Release" for "Debug" for the release version.

Type "./bin/Debug/tagEventor -h" to see the usage string.

"./bin/Debug/tagEventor" will start it in foreground mode with all the default options, with verbosity level = 0, or zero informational output (errors WILL BE output on STDERR).

How to Install as a daemon
--------------------------
You must be able to run as root to install tagEventor on the local machine.
If you can do this, then use "sudo ./install-sh".

This will do a number of things:

1) Copy the "tagEventor" binary you build above into /usr/sbin/
   -> check this works and you can execute it from there with "/usr/sbin/tagEventor"รง

2) Create (if needed) the /etc/tagEventor directory, and copy the "generic" script into it.

3) Copies the "tagEventord" init shell script into /etc/init.d for use in starting as a system daemon
   -> This script can be run manually from here also to start and stop the daemon as init would do
   -> Use "sudo /etc/init.d/tagEventord start|stop|reload|restart" (one of those four options)

4) It then creates appropriate links in the different runlevel directories (/etc/rc?.d) that each
   point to the script in /etc/init.d
   -> FYI it uses the command "update-rc.d -f tagEventord start 80 2 3 4 5 ." to do this

Now when you restart your system tagEventor should be started as a daemon with verbosity level = 2.
You can check things work by looking in /var/log/syslog for lines with "tagEventor" in them.
You will also notice a regular (1 second) slight blink of the LED on the reader as it is polled one per second by the daemon.
