=== Build Pre-requisites ===
See the SoftwareDependencies page for details on what you need to build and run tagEventor/gtagEventor.

=== How to 'make' - from the command line ===
Type "make" at the command prompt in the source directory.
You can use "make clean" then "make" to ensure you have a clean build.

You should get appropriate output from the make file and be left with tagEventor and gtagEventor (Gtk/GNOME GUI version) executables in the ./bin/Debug and ./bin/Release subdirectories.

== How to build - from an IDE ===
There are projects included for the libReader library, tagEventor command-line program and gtagEventor Gtk/Gnome GUI version for the Code::Blocks Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Open them in Code::Blocks, select the target (Debug or Release) and hit "build" or "fresh build"...

=== How to run ===
See the [Invocation Invocation page] for details on running tagEventor or gtagEventor.

How to Install as a daemon
--------------------------
You must be able to run as root to install tagEventor on the local machine.
If you can do this, then use "sudo ./install-sh".

This will do a number of things:

1) Copy the "tagEventor" binary you build above into /usr/sbin/
   -> check this works and you can execute it from there with "/usr/sbin/tagEventor"รง

2) Create (if needed) the /etc/tagEventor directory, and copy the "generic" script into it.

3) Copies the "tagEventord" init shell script into /etc/init.d for use in starting as a system daemon
   -> This script can be run manually from here also to start and stop the daemon as init would do
   -> Use "sudo /etc/init.d/tagEventord start|stop|reload|restart" (one of those four options)

4) It then creates appropriate links in the different runlevel directories (/etc/rc?.d) that each
   point to the script in /etc/init.d
   -> FYI it uses the command "update-rc.d -f tagEventord start 80 2 3 4 5 ." to do this

Now when you restart your system tagEventor should be started as a daemon with verbosity level = 2.
You can check things work by looking in /var/log/syslog for lines with "tagEventor" in them.
You will also notice a regular (1 second) slight blink of the LED on the reader as it is polled one per second by the daemon.
