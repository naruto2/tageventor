All errors (LOG_ERROR) and warnings (LOG_WARNING) are logged to syslog if in daemon mode, or output to STDERR in foreground mode. 

Informational messages (LOG_INFO) are logged to syslog (daemon mode) or output on STDOUT (foreground mode) if the currently set verbosity level is equal or higher than the messageÂ´s level. Default verbosity is 0, so no information messages are output.

See here for a list of messages output by level:

=== Level 0 ===
None - So with default setting of verbosity 0, no output is generated.

=== Level 1 ===
"Started daemon [command name] with PID=[pid] on reader [reader number], see /var/log/syslog",
"Daemon Started on reader number [reader number]
"Hangup signal received - will hangup and reconnect"
"SIGTERM received, exiting gracefully"
"Event: Tag [IN|OUT] - UID: [tag UID]"
"SAM Serial: [serial number of SAM in reader]
"SAM ID: [ID number of SAM in reader]

=== Level 2 ===

"Number of tags: [number of tags detected ]"
"Tag ID:   [tag UID]"

"Attempting to execute tag event script [tag UID as a string]"
"Successfully connected to pcscd server"
"Found [number of readers found] Readers, "
"Connected to reader: [reader number]"
"Disconnecting from reader [reader number]"
"Disconnecting from pcscd server"
"Tag Type: MIFARE_ULTRA"

=== Level 3 ===
Lower level commands sent to reader to read status, ATR, tags etc.
"APDU: [data sent as apdu in hex"
"Received: [response]
"Requesting Response Data ([number of response bytes]"
"Received: [data in hex received back]"
