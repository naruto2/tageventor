If you don't want to have to install the development pre-requisites and then build from source, then this page is for you.

The binary package can be downloaded (goto Downloads section of wiki) and installed, without having to use sources and build from scratch

Prepare:
Make a directory where you can unpack it 
  - mkdir tagEventor
  - cd tagEventor

Get it:
Download tagEventor-(version).tar.gz from the Downloads section to the tagEventor/ directory

Unpack it:
It will create subdirectories.
  - tar -xvzf tagEventor.tar.gz

Install it:
Still need to have root permissions to install, script checks this.
  - sudo ./install-sh
