  * -v *verbosity level* : default = 0 (silent), max = 3 
  * -d start | stop : start or stop daemon, default = foreground
  * -r *secs* : retry delay to connect to reader (seconds), default = 10
  * -p *usecs* : tag polling delay (micro seconds), default = 1000000
  * -h : print this message

*NOTE: To start the daemon you will need permission for /etc/tagEventor and hence you will probably need to start it as root, or with the "sudo" command!*

  * -r retry_time: is no reader is found the program loops trying to connect to it, waiting for this specified time in seconds between each try. Default is 10 seconds.

  * - p poll_time: this is the time in microseconds between each poll of the card reader. Default is 1000,000 (1Million), or 1 second.
