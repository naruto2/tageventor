=== To Build tagEventor ===
To develop against PCSCD, including building tagEventor you will need the packages:
  * libpcsclite1 - the library
  * libpcsclite-dev - the header files

   * If you want to compile the evolving UI prototypes to see what they look like you will need Gtk2-0. Projects are included for Code::Blocks IDE so you might want to get that.

=== Link Time ===
  * *libpcsclite* to link executable.

   * If you want to compile the evolving UI prototypes to see what they look like you will need *Glade* and it's libraries.

=== Run Time ===
You'll need the "pcsc-lite" package on your machine which runes the "pcscd" daemon, if not already there (it comes with most Linux disctributions and Mac OS X).
It maybe called "pcscd". From the terminal type "ps -ef | grep pcsc" to see if it's there. Best to try that with a reader plugged-in.

The ACS reader will need the *libccid* driver installed, should be loaded by pcscd.
