=== PCSC Lite dev  - ISSUE ===
  * I still have to modify the header files of the pcsc-lite dev files to get includes to work correctly. Either modify the code or Makefile to fix this, or confirm definatively and contact the developers with a patch (I e-mailed once already)

=== Starting 'X' Programs from a daemon  - ISSUE ===
This is another major reported issue we really need to get out of the way ASAP.

=== Daemon code review ===
  * I´d really appreciate someone with experience on writing linux or unix daemon´s taking a look at the code in tagEventor.c for the daemon, for mutual exclusion using lock files as I´m not convinced it´s bulletproof.
  * Also, I´d like it to check for the lockfile BEFORE it forks, so that an error message can be given to the user or script invoking it before it forks and fails. Then best to lock it again in the forked process to be sure.

=== init scripts ===
  * The init scripts could be improved a bit I think in a number of ways, such as catching a few corner cases that might cause failures, as well as making more standard compared to others. In doing that I think some of the logic in the application itself for daemonizing could be simplified and made more portable, as at the moment the 'C' code does what many others do in the init script.

=== Security / authentication ===
  * it seems there is some mechanism with the embedded SAM card in the tag reader to do some authentication to the reader. Not sure how it applies, works or how to implement it!
  * I´d like to have the program also get the local PC MAC address being used, and the processor ID and maybe use them as additional security or to authenticate a client device.

=== Tag read / write ===
  * I *think* that in the Mi-Fare tags used a few bytes can be reprogrammed. So, write a script or program to:-
    * Read the entire contents of the Mi-fare tag memory (see spec document in download section)
    * Write the bytes that can be written, and read them back to verify
