# Autelic Association #
At the non-profit Autelic association (http://www.autelic.org) we are trying to develop technology solutions easier to use for all. We execute projects to this end to demonstrate that with a different set of goals and methodologies that major improvements can be made for the benefit of many users who currently won't or can't use existing computers, OS and the Internet.

# Projects #
The proposed projects will change over time, so probably best to check out Autelic web for the latest ideas (http://www.autelic.org).
