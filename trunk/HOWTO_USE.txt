HOWTO USE for tagEventor
========================

How to download
---------------
This is documented in the "source" tab of the wiki at http://code.google.com/p/tc-squared.
You can use svn to check out the whole tc-squared project, or just the "tagEventor" subdirectory.

How to make
-----------
cd tc-squared/tagEventor and type "make" :-)
You should get appropriate output from the make file and be left with a tagEventor executable object in the current working directory.

NOTE: I continue to have issues with the way the PCSCLite header files incldue their other internal library header files. They use #include <> for example for wintypes.h, and I think it should be #include "". I modified them to do that and then everything builds no problem. I also think that´s the recommended way to include files inside a library known to be in the same directory. The <> construct is used to tell the compiler to seach in standard system include directories....I´ve mentioned to the developers and will be double checking....

How to run
----------
Type "./tagEventor -h" to see the usage string.

"./tagEventor" will start it in foreground mode with all the default options, with verbosity level = 0, or zero informational output (errors are output).

How to Install as a daemon
--------------------------
You must be able to run as root to install tagEventor on the local machine.
If you can do this, then use "sudo make install".

This will do a number of things:

1) Copy the "tagEventor" binary you build above into /usr/sbin/
   -> check this works and you can execute it from there with "/usr/sbin/tagEventor"ç

2) Create (if needed) the /etc/tagEventor directory, and copy the "generic" script into it.

3) Copies the "tagEventord" init shell script into /etc/init.d for use in starting as a system daemon
   -> This script can be run manually from here also to start and stop the daemon as init would do
   -> Use "sudo /etc/init.d/tagEventord start|stop|reload|restart" (one of those four options)

4) It then creates appropriate links in the different runlevel directories (/etc/rc?.d) that each
   point to the script in /etc/init.d
   -> FYI it uses the command "update-rc.d -f tagEventord start 80 2 3 4 5 ." to do this

Now when you restart your system tagEventor should be started as a daemon with verbosity level = 2. 
You can check things work by looking in /var/log/syslog for lines with "tagEventor" in them.
You will also notice a regular (1 second) slight blink of the LED on the reader as it is polled one per second by the daemon.
