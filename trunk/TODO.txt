Add the regexp matching of the tagID inside tagEventDispatch()

Improve the install script, and have it check and use options. Install things optionally not all at once.

Get Icon theme and search path stuff to work...

Make the default setting for reader number to be AUTO, not fixed at zero, and then to search for a valid reader.

Extend the code to search for, connect to, and then use upto five simultaneously connected readers.
Shouldn't be too difficult. Use the bitmap set from the Settings UI. Change command line to enable AUTO.

Rename the ControlPanel to be the rules editor. Clean up the concepts of tags, tag events, and actions in all of program.
Change About text to match.

Wwhen we start up as system tray or foreground (i.e. ALWAYS), try and ensure we are the only instance running
either for a given reader number (as at the moment), or if reader number = AUTO that we are the only instance
globally on this machine.
Maybe pop-up an error when another is detected, with it's PID

Build:
Avoid use of pkg-config (use correct flags directly) and fix problem with -lpcsclite so that the Mac version can also be built from the command line with "make".

Scripts:
Modify the example scripts somehow so that they also run on Mac OS X, where for example Xmessage (used by the "generic" script) is not present.

Install:
Check the install script and directories for Mac OS X and make the necessary changes.

Mac OS X GUI:
Investigate Gtk+ on Mac OS X (seems to only work with dependencies that require Leopard or Snow Leopard), or other ways to have the UI version also work.

Man page:
Write something useful in the man page, and then modify the install script to copy it to the appropriate location.


Future Ideas:
Generate compound events that are defined by TWO tags, such as "Andrew's tag" AND "e-mail tag", to be an event to read andrew's e-mail.

Think about if it's useful to define "states" as well as events, so that something is done or maintained WHILE a certain tag or tags are
detected.
